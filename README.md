# General Cancer Probability Prediction (GCPP)

Welcome to the **General Cancer Probability Prediction (GCPP)** project. This repository provides a Python-based implementation to predict the probability of cancer based on various input parameters. The project uses predefined rules and calculations to analyze and predict the likelihood of cancer, aiming to assist in early detection and diagnosis.

## Installation

To run the GCPP system locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Qyuzet/python-general-cancer-probability-prediction--gcpp.git
    cd python-general-cancer-probability-prediction--gcpp
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or later). Install the required packages using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    You can start the application using:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Upon running the application, you will be guided through a registration and screening process where you will input various details like age, gender, domicile, and answer several health-related questions. The system will then calculate and display your general cancer risk probability.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Collects basic user information such as name, age, sex, and domicile.
- **Health Screening**: Asks a series of questions related to lifestyle, genetic factors, and environmental exposures to assess cancer risk.
- **Risk Calculation**: Computes the cancer risk probability based on the provided inputs using predefined rules.
- **Progress Indicators**: Provides visual feedback during data processing.
- **Data Storage**: Saves user inputs and results in a CSV file for future reference and analysis.

## Demo

You can try out the GCPP system directly on Replit. Fork the project and run it in your own Replit environment:
